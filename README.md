##### Administrator Switchboard

#### Administrator Switchboard is a free software aimed to help:

- Malware victims: Some important functions of your Windows system have been disabled by a malware? Use AS to enable them again. This    works however only if the malware didnâ€™t corrupt the exe files of Windows.

- System administrators: you may want to restrict access to these functions, to avoid other users tampering with the system.

- Users with limited access (Windows XP only): And if you are just a guest user, but need access to those functions, you can use AS to quickly enable them.

#### You can use it to enable or disable some important functions of your Windows:

- Task Manager
- Registry editor
- Run command
- Windows Update
- Windows Security Center
